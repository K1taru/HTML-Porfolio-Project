<hr />

<h3>Demon Slayer Movie</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime. The animation is oustanding.</p>

<h3>Kingsman</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie for almost a decade now. I recommend watching it and the other prequel and sequel.</p>

<h3>Queen's Gambit</h3>
<p>Its a series I watched before. It revolves around the life of a female chess player who dominated the game even against very strong opponents. Still deverves to be on this spot.</p>
